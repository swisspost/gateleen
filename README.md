# [\_] Gateleen
Middleware library based on Vert.x to build advanced JSON/REST communication servers.

## Getting Started
### Install
* Clone this repository or unzip [archive](https://github.com/swisspush/gateleen/archive/master.zip)
* Install and start Redis
  * Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get install redis-server`
  * Fedora/RedHat/CentOS: `yum install redis`
  * OS X: `brew install redis`
  * [Windows](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases/download/win-2.8.2400/Redis-x64-2.8.2400.zip)
  * [Other](http://redis.io/download)

### Build
You need Java 8 and Maven.
```
cd gateleen
mvn install
```
### Play
The `gateleen-playground` module provides a server example.
```
java -jar gateleen-playground/target/playground.jar
```
It starts on [http://localhost:7012/playground](http://localhost:7012/playground)

The storage is currently empty, that's why you get `404 Not Found`

Create your first resource with
```
curl -X PUT -d '{ "foo": "bar" }' http://localhost:7012/playground/hello/world
```
or any other [REST Client](https://www.google.ch/?q=rest+client)

Now you can see the resource appear in [http://localhost:7012/playground](http://localhost:7012/playground)

The playground module provides a convenient web client for manipulating resources and a basic configuration.

You can push them with
```
cd gateleen-playground
mvn wagon:upload
```
This just PUTs all resources from folder `src/main/resources`

Then go again on [http://localhost:7012/playground](http://localhost:7012/playground)

|:------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------:|
| x-rp-unique-id     | unique id | |

| x-expire-After     | indicates how long (in seconds) a request is 'valid' before it expires | |
| x-hooked           | used by the HookHandler to indicate the original hook request as hooked | [gateleen-hook](gateleen-hook/README_hook.md) |

## Performance Tuning
* The amount of max open files per process should be at least 16384. You can check your max open files per process with this command `cat /proc/<process id>/limits`.
* The amount of open files depends on the amount of open Http Requests, which are holding a tcp connection which are holding a file handle.
* The important number to control the open Http Requests is the pool size of the Http Client. The higher the pool size the higher the open files.

## Dependencies
* [vertx-rest-storage](https://github.com/swisspush/vertx-rest-storage) at least release [v2.0.2](https://github.com/swisspush/vertx-rest-storage/releases/tag/v2.0.2)
* [vertx-redisques](https://github.com/swisspush/vertx-redisques) at least release [v.2.0.1](https://github.com/swisspush/vertx-redisques/releases/tag/2.0.1)
