# gateleen-performancetest
Execute performance tests using [Gatling load testing framework](http://gatling.io/#/)

## Configuration
The following configuration values are required


| Name       | Description |
| :----------| :----- |
| targetHost | The host where the tests should be executed against |
| targetPort | The port of the target host where the tests should be executed against |
| numberOfUsers | The number of users executing the scenario |
| rampUpTime | The time in seconds to ramp up the defined number of users for the test scenario |

## Prepare server resources
To have the correct server resources like routing rules and acls used for the Gatling tests, the following gradle task should be applied **before** the tests:
### Windows
```
gradlew.bat uploadStaticFiles -PtargetHost=mytargethost -PtargetPort=1234
```

### Linux/Unix
```
./gradlew uploadStaticFiles -PtargetHost=mytargethost -PtargetPort=1234
```

## Executing Gatling simulations
The Gatling simulations can be started with the following command:
### Windows
```
gradlew.bat gatling -PtargetHost=mytargethost -PtargetPort=1234
```

### Linux/Unix
```
./gradlew gatling -PtargetHost=mytargethost -PtargetPort=1234
```

## Test scenarios
The following scenarios described below are implmented in [GateleenPerformanceTestSimulation.scala](src/test/scala/gatling/simulations/GateleenPerformanceTestSimulation.scala)

### Scenario prepareExpandResources
This scenario is used to prepare the resources for the tests testing gateleens _Expansion_ feature. A single "user" writes 120 json resources to a collection,
which later can be requested with the expand parameter.

### Scenario regularExpand
**Description:**

Making _regular_ expand requests to the collection prepared in scenario _prepareExpandResources_. _Regular_ expand requests make another request for each resource in the collection.

**Setup:**

Taking values from real world applications, Gateleen should be able to server 42'000 requests over a duration of 15 minutes. The tests are configured to use 75% of this load. So the setup is set to:
> 42'000 requests during 15 minute => 47 req/s * 75% = 35 req/s

### Scenario storageExpand
**Description:**

Making _storage_ expand requests to the collection prepared in scenario _prepareExpandResources_. _Storage_ expand requests make the expansion directly in the storage.

**Setup:**

Taking values from real world applications, Gateleen should be able to server 42'000 requests over a duration of 20 minutes. The tests are configured to use 75% of this load. So the setup is set to:
> 42'000 requests during 20 minute => 35 req/s * 75% = 26 reg/s

### Scenario storageOperations
Making _CRUD_ storage requests. The requests include PUT, GET and DELETE requests for json values.

### Scenario enqueueRequests
**Description:**

Making queued PUT requests.

**Setup:**

Having 10 users per second over 2 minutes making each 50 requests to a queue result in the following load.
> 1200 different queueus with 50 queue entries each => 60'000 requests total
